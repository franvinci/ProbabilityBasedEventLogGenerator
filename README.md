# ProbabilityBasedEventLogGenerator
Code related to the implementation of the paper ''Event-Log Augmentation: An Experimental Comparison of Existing and of a Novel Alternative Proposal''

The code has been developed and tested on Both Windows 11 and Linux 22.04 LTS. With a Python 3.10.2 environment. The laptop running the code has 16GB of RAM and an Intel Core i7-10750H CPU @ 2.60GHz Ã— 12. For storing all the Profiles generated, we used the SSD memory of the laptot, with 1TB of space.

# How to run the code
Create a virtual environment with the requirements in requirements.txt

Create a folder "Sota", and fill it with the experiments from "https://zenodo.org/records/5734443" and "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gmO8ULxtBxqShXnBeEUhBLOy97KYlVI2"

from shell run "python3 run_simulations.py"

Use the python notebook "LogDistanceMeasuresSim.ipynb" for testing and producing the measures.
